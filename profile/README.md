# UEA Teaching

This repository holds the material I use to lecture at the University of East Anglia.

## Subjects

The modules I am teaching at the moment include:

- [Introduction to Python](https://uea-teaching.github.io/python-introduction/)
- [Computing Principles](https://uea-teaching.github.io/computing-principles)
- [Web Based Programming](https://uea-teaching.github.io/web-based-programming)

- [Computer Vision](https://uea-teaching.github.io/computer-vision-2022)

There is an online version of each presentation at the link above.

## Source code

I write my slides using `Markdown`, and convert to pdf and html using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
All the source code is available in separate repositories at the links below.

You can access the markdown files directly, which are particularly suitable for low bandwidth users.
